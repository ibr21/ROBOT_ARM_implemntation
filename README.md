# ROBOT_ARM_implemntation
A robotic arm is a type of mechanical arm, usually programmable, with similar functions to a human arm. In this task we have five servo motors ,connected with five potentiometers to control the movement of the arm. connecting 5 servo motors with potentiometers.  The arm can be rotated from 90 to -90 degrees. The used components are:  1 Arduino Uno , 5 Potentiometers,  5 servo motors. The used software is the Arduino. I used servo library to implement the program. I also used Tinker CAD software to simulate the robot arm and check its working. The used pins are: PWM: 8,9,10,11,12 for the servo motors, and Analog pins A1,A2,A3,A4,A5 for the potentiometers.
